## What is Kernel Image Processing?
### Details
Image Processing is a method of image processing that allows one to blur, sharpen, edge detect, etc. an image. This process uses matrices, which is the kernel, and it also uses a mathematical process called convolution.
### Kernel
A Kernel is simply a matrix, typically 3x3 or 5x5, that has different values depending on the effect it should achieve. Each value within a kernel becomes important in the mathematics of the changing of a pixel. A Normalized Kernel would have elements, whose sum is one.
### Convolution
Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel. This is related to a form of mathematical convolution. <i>From Wikipedia</i>
